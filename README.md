## Usage

1. **Dataset and Environment Setup**  
   Please first follow the instructions from [ReactFace](https://github.com/lingjivoo/ReactFace) to complete the following configurations:
   - Dataset download and directory organization.
   - Python environment setup (including dependencies).
   - Download and placement of other required files.

2. **Set Pre-trained Model Paths**  
   Before running the code, please modify the following two files to specify the paths to your pre-trained models:

   - **Code A**: `model/speaker_former.py`  

   - **Code B**: `model/video_encoder.py`  

3. **Run Training or Inference**  
The training and inference procedures are the same as in ReactFace. Please refer to the [ReactFace](https://github.com/lingjivoo/ReactFace) for commands and usage examples.
